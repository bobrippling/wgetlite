WGetLite
--------

A wget compatible/curl lookalike, intended to be small on features.
(Not cloned from wget... imagine trying to filter the good out of all that code)

Supports HTTP, FTP and Gopher, resume-able downloading, HTTP User-Agent "spoofing",
HTTP cookie loading (for those pesky video sites), and ... that's about it.
